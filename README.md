# Linkedin Application Tracker

## *This application is just made for fun, not a fully developed extension. You are welcomed to use it as you wish.*

An extension to automatically log your LinkedIn job applications to a single spreadsheet. Track your applications with company name, position, location, and application date.

This is a simple extension I made to show how desperate it is to apply for jobs on LinkedIn, or maybe you just have fun collecting information about your life like me. Just for fun.

# How to set up?

Just follow the steps down below. It's not rocket science.

> **IMPORTANT:** DO NOT FORGET TO RIGHT-CLICK AND **`EXTRACT ALL`** THE ZIP FILE! OTHERWISE, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO UPLOAD THE EXTENSION TO YOUR BROWSER!!!!

### 2. Upload the Extension in Chrome

4.  Open your Chrome browser and type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar and press Enter. **OR** simply click the puzzle icon on the right side of the search bar and click `Manage extensions`.

5.  Activate the **"Developer mode"** switch in the top-right corner.

7.  On the file selection screen, select the **`linkedin-job-tracker-main`** folder you extracted in step 3 and press "Select Folder".

The installation is complete! You will see the extension icon in your browser's toolbar. You can now start using it.

# So how to use that?

<img alt="Extension icon in toolbar" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39168aa6-93a4-4da4-a6d0-ff5fac5af198" />

After you click the extension, you will see the popup shown below.

<img alt="Extension popup window" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee0d9c19-928b-47a3-8753-3001aedd2950" />

For the first-time user, you need to go to the **`Settings`** page to make one of the biggest choices of your life.
Here in the settings, you can either choose to use my template as a prebuilt table for your comfort (I already designed the whole system on that table btw)...

<sub> *...or you can use your fancy table if you like* </sub> but I need to warn you, <ins>my table is already okay...</ins>

<img alt="Extension settings page" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ed3c8a3-2452-4af2-9950-c9e2bf1c2484" />

If you choose wisely (I mean my template), the extension will ask for Google Drive permission. With that permission, you will have your own super-secret unemployment table. A copy of [this table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/138_o2fC39qJjVmbRc4l2aYoFwpMKG4UbsQg2RLin7Yk/edit?usp=sharing) will be created in your own Drive as 'Restricted', and it will automatically open in a new tab.

<img alt="Google permission request" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a519b732-ab21-419d-b80c-453ac94b3137" />

After creating your new super-duper table for your unemployment journey, the extension will automatically save your spreadsheet to its memory. Now you are ready to go.

Go to the best job application you can find to get rejected from on LinkedIn and click the extension. You will now see two buttons.

* **`Add to Sheet`**: Adds the Company Name, Position Name, Location, Today's Date, and "Application Sent" status to the spreadsheet.
* **`Open Tracking Sheet`**: Opens the spreadsheet you have created <sub> *(or your *different* spreadsheet which I know nothing about).* </sub>

<img alt="Using the extension on a job page" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/220027e9-331a-46ff-9dcb-e28305d55a6a" />

At the end, you will have something like this. You can look at all of these companies and maybe have some bad thoughts, idk.

<img alt="Final spreadsheet view" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e073930-6fad-49c7-b74d-2d3c0e0ce1e8" />

Columns F and G will be empty because I don't know when they will contact you. You can manually fill in column F. Then, if you want to calculate how long the company took to respond, you can simply use the formula `=F2-D2` and then propagate the formula down by double-clicking the cute little green dot on the bottom right of the cell.

And that's it. Have fun, I guess.

> **Note:** The table itself only has the Turkish version right now, and I am not willing to create a new English version, <sub>sorry.</sub>
