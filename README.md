# Linkedin-Application-Tracker ---- _This application is just made for fun, not fully developed extension, you are welcomed to use that as you wish_
Browser extension to create and automatically log your linkedin job applications to single spreadsheet to follow your applications with company name, position, location and application date. 

This is just a simple extension I made it to show how desperate is to apply jobs in linkedin, or maybe you just have fun collection information about your life as me. Just for fun.

After you click to extension you will see the popup shown below.

For the first time user, you need to go to the settings page to choose one of the biggest choices you will ever make in your life.
Here in the settings you can either choose to use my template table as prebuilt table for your comfort. I already designed the whole system on that table btw. 

<sub> _or you can use your fancy table you like_ </sub> but I need to warn you, <ins> my table is already okay...</ins>

If you choose wisely (I mean my template table) extension will ask you for the google drive permission, with that permission you will have your own super secret unemployment table and you will have a copy of [this table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/138_o2fC39qJjVmbRc4l2aYoFwpMKG4UbsQg2RLin7Yk/edit?gid=0#gid=0) in your own drive and it will be created as 'Restricted'. You will automatically see your new table in new tab.

After creating your new super duper table for your unemployment journey, extension will automatically save your spreadsheet to its own memory and now you are ready to go. 

After setting up everything go to the best job application you find to get rejected in the linkedin page and click to the extension, right now you will see two buttons.

***Add to Sheet*** Button will add the Company Name, Position Name, Location, Todays Date, "Application Sent" status to the spreadsheet. 
***Open Tracking Sheet*** Button will open the spreadsheet you have created, <sub> _or your different spreadsheet which I do not anything about it_ </sub>

At the end you will have something like this. You can look at all of these company and have some bad thoughts maybe, idk. 

<img width="898" height="271" alt="6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e073930-6fad-49c7-b74d-2d3c0e0ce1e8" />

Column F and G will be empty in your case, because I do not when will they contact with you. So you can manually control the F column. Then if you want to calculate how long the company took to respond you, you can simply use that formula `=F2-D2` and then propagate the formula down with double clicking the green cute little dot on the bottom right of the cell. 

And that's it. Have fun. ig.
